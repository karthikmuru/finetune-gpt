# finetune-gpt

The purpose of this project is to showcase the process of fine tuning a pretrained GPT model to produce personalized text that mimics the style of a different text corpus. For demonstation, a pretrianed GPT2 model was trained on the lyrics of some Taylor Swift songs to generate text with the same style as her songs. 

Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thespacefreak/taylor-swift-song-lyrics-all-albums

## Finetuning / Training  : finetune.py 

Example usage :   
```
 python3 finetune.py --epochs 5 --output_dir './models/ts2' --data_dir './notebooks/taylor_swift_lyrics.csv'
```

## Generating Lyrics : generate.py

Example usage : 
```
 python3 generate.py --model_dir './models/ts2' --prompt 'hello' --max_length 100
```

**Sample output:**    
prompt : /beautiful day'    
max_length : 100
```
beautiful day
 The stars shine through the shaded sky
 The song's playing and it seems like we're at home
 All we know is that we're dreaming
 But we don't know what
 We're doing
 And we're getting tired of it
 You're so small, like
 Love in a bottle
 Hold on tight, baby
 Even though we're so far away
 You've got your eyes like diamonds

```
